    <h2>Objective : </h2>
    <p>project aims to create a software solution that contributes to a safer and more trustworthy online environment
         by effectively detecting and reporting fake social media profiles while respecting privacy and user rights.
        </p>
    <h3>The steps are :</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Data Collection:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>To gather profiles from social media networks (such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram), set up data scraping or API integration.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Data Pre-processing</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Prepare the gathered data for analysis by cleaning it up, eliminating unnecessary information, and structuring it.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Profile Features</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Establish a set of criteria for analysing each profile, such as activity patterns, friend and follower networks, post content, and profile image analysis.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li> Machine Learning Model :</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Use labelled data to train a machine learning model (such as a binary classifier). Labelled data ought to include both fictitious and real profiles.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Profile Scoring</li>
        <ul>
            <li> 
                Assign a likelihood score, or the possibility that a given profile is fraudulent, to each one using the trained model.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Threshold Setting :</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Decide on a cut-off point for a profile's classification as real or fraudulent. Profiles that score higher than this are marked as potentially suspicious.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Reporting System :</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Provide a reporting feature that allows users to flag questionable accounts right from within the program.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>User Feedback Loop :</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Over time, the accuracy of the model may be increased by incorporating user feedback. Permit users to verify if profiles are authentic or fraudulent.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Alerts and Notifications :</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Notify users or administrators via alerts or notifications if a suspicious profile is found or reported</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Dashboard and Reporting: </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Provide a dashboard where administrators and users may examine data, patterns, and specifics regarding identified fraudulent accounts
            </li>
            </ul>
